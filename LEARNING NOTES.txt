1. if an external src of a link is given in nextjs Image then it has to be added to whitelist via next.config.js
module.exports = {
    images: {
        domains: ['links.papareact.com','fakestoreapi.com']
    }
}

2.  Product feed UI
    -   Grid is better for cases where products are to be mapped
    -   use array.slice() to alter grid design
    -   ALSO NOTE that grid-flow-row-dense takes the space left in a row automatically.
    -   without dense grid items do not take free space

3.  Design UI
    -   don't think about the layers first, start adding in the visible components

4.  Use tailwind plugins:
    -   require("@tailwindcss/line-clamp")
        -   to limit the lines in a para

5.  Setting up google oauth:
    -   setup firebase for the database storage
    -   after creating oauth consent screen
        -   create oauth credential for web application
        -   add the firebase authDomain: "fir-80806.firebaseapp.com" to Authorized JavaScript origins section
        -   add all http://localhosts:
            -   http://localhost
            -   http://localhost/5000
            -   http://localhost/3000
        -   add https://fir-80806.firebaseapp.com/_/auth/handler to Authorized redirect URIs
        -   add http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
    
    -   What all above does is that it gives google authorization to accept requests from only those domains

6.  Using next-auth
    1.  create dir /api/auth/[...nextauth].js
    2.  add in the next-auth/client's signIn, signOut and useSession wherever necessary
    3.  [...nextauth].js would contain all the required providers and can also have email, pswd authentication
    4.  in _app.js, add the Provider for session
